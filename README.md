I finished [Information Technology](http://wmii.uwm.edu.pl/) studies at [University of Warmia and Mazury](http://www.uwm.edu.pl/).  
I also have 5 years of commercial experience with writing *various* django (python-based web framework) stuff.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on myself - I really want to take break from IT stuff and lose weight
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning real frontend frameworks, other than *jQuery*
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Linux or Hackintoshes - do you remember GNU/Linux paste or golden Hackintosh Poland 2015/2016 era?

### My engineering thesis:

The topic of engineer thesis was social media platform. 
I implemented it using Django, PostgreSQL database backend, also I used Django-Channels, Django-Allauth, REST and jQuery libraries. 
The whole project was wrote with queries and code optimization at Python level. 

### My projects:
